1. **Deal the entire deck** evenly among the players.  
   Each player may look at all their cards.

2. The **first player** plays a card — this sets the **leading suit** for that round.

3. On each turn:
   - You **must play a card of the same suit** if you have one.  
   - If you don’t, play *any* card.  
   - To **win the trick**, play a card of the same suit with a **higher value** than the leading card.

4. Once all players have played, the **highest card of the leading suit** wins the round.  
   The winner collects the cards into their personal pile.

5. The winner of the trick **leads the next round**.

6. After all cards are played, count the **DENARI (Coins)** cards you’ve collected:  
   Each DENARI card gives **points equal to its value**
